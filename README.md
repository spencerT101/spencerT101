### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Spencer, a junior software developer.

I graduated from CodeClan, a digital skills academy that offered a specialist bootcamp in professional software development. The course involved 800+ hours of coding over 16 weeks covering the languages  Python, Javascript and Java, while utilising the frameworks Flask, ReactJS, and Spring Boot.

Checkout my pinned repo's which demonstrate some of the projects I have worked on during the course and after.
